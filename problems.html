        <h2>If you're missing sick pay</h2>
        <p>Check your contract to see what sick pay you're entitled to. In some roles you need to be off for at least 4
          consecutive days before you get any sick pay.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sick pay is paid "in arrears" - this means it will go into your next payslip if you were off in the last 2
          weeks before the current payday.</p>
