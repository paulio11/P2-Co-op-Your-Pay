        <h2>How the calculator works</h2>
        <p>First of all you need to understand how overtime and breaks work.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Concerning overtime</h3>
        <p>Any hours you work beyond your contract hours in a single week are considered overtime. Overtime is paid to
          you in two halves. Overtime worked within the first two weeks of the pay period is paid that payday, and any
          overtime worked within the last two weeks of the pay period is paid on the next payday.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Concerning breaks</h3>
        <p>If you work a shift longer than 7 hours 30 minutes you are entitled to a 30 minute unpaid break. For example,
          if you work a shift of 8 hours you will be paid for 7 hours 30 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The calculator takes both these factors into consideration when estimating your pay for the period. Holiday
          hours worked and owed overtime from the last pay period are included in the final estimate if applicable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box" id="payslip">
        <h2>How to see your payslip</h2>
        <p>You'll be able to see your next payslip on the Wednesday before payday. You can also view and download
